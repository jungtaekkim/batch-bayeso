# Re-implementation of Batch Bayesian Optimization

This repository is to re-implement several baseline methods in batch Bayesian optimization, using [BayesO](https://github.com/jungtaekkim/bayeso).

## Algorithms

- Batch Bayesian optimization with random query selection
- Batch Bayesian optimization with a constant liar
- Batch Bayesian optimization via local penalization
